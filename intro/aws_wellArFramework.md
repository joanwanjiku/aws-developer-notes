# Well architected framework
- consists of 5 pillars
- architectural best practises for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient and cost-effective systems in the cloud.
- tool and technique to understand the pros and consof decisions while designing systems.
- measure against architecture aganist best practises.
- AWS WA tool, is a service in the cloud that provides a consistent process for reviewing and measuring architecture using the AWS well-architected framework. WA tool gives recommendations for making secure, effiecient, cost-effectivetive, operational excellent, reliable

1. Cost optimization:- systems run at the lowest price point to deliver business value.
    - Implement cloud financial management
    - Adopt a consumption model: pay for only the required computing resources.
    - Measure overall efficiency
    - Stop spending money on undifferentiated heavy lifting
2. Performance efficiency:- use computing resources to meet system requirements and maintain efficiency as demand changes.
    - Go global in minutes.
    - Use serverless architectures.
    - Experiment more often:- use vitual and automatable resources to carry out testing
    - Delegating complex tasks to AWS by using technology-as-a-service.
3. Security:- Protect data, systems and assets by taking advantage of cloud technologies
    - Strong identity foundation:- least privilege, separation of duties
    - Enable traceability:- monitor, alert and audit environment
    - Apply security at all layers
    - Protect data in transit and at rest.
4. Operational excellence:- support development and run workloads effectively, gain insights into their operations and to continously improve supporting processes and procedures to deliver business value.
    - Refine operations procedures frequently
    - Anticipate failure
    - Make frequent, small, reversible changes.
    - Learn from all operational failures.
    - perform operations as code.
5. Reliability:- ability of a workload to perform its intended function correctly and consistently at the expected time, includes ability to operate and test the workload through its total lifecycle.
    - Automatically recover from failures
    - test recovery procedures.
    - Scale horizontally to increase aggregate workload availability.
    - Stop geusining capacity
